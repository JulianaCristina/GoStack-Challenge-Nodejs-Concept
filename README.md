	<h1>GoStack Bootcamp Challenge - Node.js Concepts  </h1>
</div>

### About the challenge :rocket:
In this challenge, an application was created to train what I have learned so far in Node.js!

This will be an application to store repositories in your portfolio, which will allow the creation, listing, updating and removal of the repositories, and also allow the repositories to receive "likes".

### Aplication Routes :car:
- POST /repositories
- GET /repositories
- PUT /repositories/:id
- DELETE /repositories/:id
- POST /repositories/:id/like
